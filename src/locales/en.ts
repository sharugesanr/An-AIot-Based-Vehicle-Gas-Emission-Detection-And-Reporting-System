    question1: 'How is the emission data collected?',
    answer1: 'The emission data is collected through IoT sensors installed in your vehicle that monitor CO and CO₂ levels in real-time. These sensors transmit data to our secure cloud platform for analysis and visualization.',
    question2: 'What do the different emission levels mean?',
    answer2: 'Green indicates safe emission levels within regulatory standards. Yellow indicates elevated levels that are approaching regulatory limits. Red indicates levels that exceed regulatory standards and require immediate attention.',
    question3: 'How often is the fitness certificate renewed?',
    answer3: 'Fitness certificates are typically renewed annually, but regulations may vary by region. The application shows the exact due date for your next renewal based on local regulations.',
    question4: 'Can I receive alerts for high emission levels?',
    answer4: 'Yes, you can configure notifications in your profile settings to receive alerts via email or SMS when your vehicle\'s emissions exceed safe thresholds.',
    question5: 'How accurate is the location tracking?',
    answer5: 'Our GPS tracking system is accurate to within 3-5 meters under normal conditions. Accuracy may be affected in areas with poor GPS signal such as tunnels or dense urban areas.',
